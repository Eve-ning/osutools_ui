# Introduction

Keep it short, make a simulator that plays VSRG

# THE PLAN

1. Create an interface for **VSRG Charts**
2. Create an interface for the **Player**
3. Create an environment where both of those **interact**

  We want to be able to test out the parameters

# THE PLAN +

4. Simulate the plays and train the machine according to players

# VSRG Chart Interface

We will be trimming out all the unnecessary information that a **note** can hold, such as:

- *hitsound*
- *snap*
- *scroll speed*

So we will just need 

- *column*
- *offset*
- *type*
  
  *note, long_note_head, long_note_end*
  
All of these would be done in Python, then we will import into R.
